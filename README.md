# Ultrawide Cutscenes

A [Dalamud](https://github.com/goatcorp/Dalamud) plugin for Final Fantasy XIV that removes the letterboxing bars displayed during cutscenes on ultrawide monitors, allowing cutscenes to fill your full screen.

> **Note:** Because this expands the rendered viewport beyond the game's intended cutscene boundaries, you may occasionally see things you aren't supposed to — NPCs popping in at the edges, T-poses, scene geometry loading, etc. This is expected behavior and not a bug.

## Download

The latest release can be found on the [Releases page](https://github.com/DukePantarei/Dalamud.FullscreenCutscenes/releases/latest).

## Requirements

- [Final Fantasy XIV](https://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/)
- [XIVLauncher](https://goatcorp.github.io/) with Dalamud enabled

## Installation

### Manual / Developer Install

1. Download `Dalamud.FullscreenCutscenes.dll` from the [latest release](https://github.com/DukePantarei/Dalamud.FullscreenCutscenes/releases/latest).
2. Open Dalamud settings with `/xlsettings`, go to **Experimental**, and add the full path to `Dalamud.FullscreenCutscenes.dll` under **Dev Plugin Locations**.
3. Open `/xlplugins`, navigate to **Dev Tools → Installed Dev Plugins**, and enable **Ultrawide Cutscenes**.

## Usage

The plugin is active as soon as it's enabled — there's no configuration required. Letterboxing will be removed automatically whenever a cutscene plays.

## Known Limitations

- The expanded viewport may reveal unfinished scene elements at the edges of the screen (NPC pop-in, T-poses, etc.).
- The plugin requires updates when Dalamud's API version changes; if the plugin stops working after a game or Dalamud update, check here for an updated release.
